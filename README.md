        <h1>Gold Recovery Prediction</h1>
        <p><b>Optimizing Efficiency in Gold Ore Processing using ML</b></p>
</div>

In the rapidly evolving landscape of heavy industries, efficiency and optimization have become paramount for sustainable growth and profitability. The gold mining sector, in particular, faces _the challenge of extracting maximum value from its raw materials while minimizing wastage and inefficiencies_. To address these challenges, **[Zyfra](https://www.zyfra.com/)**, a pioneering developer of **efficiency solutions for heavy industries**, is aiming to take help of machine learning to optimize the efficiency in Gold Ore processing.

This project centers around the **application of machine learning to predict the amount of gold that can be recovered from gold ore during the extraction and purification processes**. By accurately forecasting gold recovery rates, mining operations can optimize production, reduce operational costs, and eliminate unprofitable parameters.

## Project Goal

The goals of the project can be outlined as follows:

1. **Gold Recovery Prediction**: The primary objective of the project is to develop accurate machine learning models that can predict the amount of gold that will be recovered from gold ore.

2. **Optimization of Production**: By accurately predicting gold recovery rates, the project aims to optimize the production process in the gold mining sector. This optimization involves identifying factors that contribute to higher recovery rates and reducing those that lead to inefficiencies and wastage.

3. **Elimination of Unprofitable Parameters**: The project aims to identify and eliminate parameters that have a negative impact on gold recovery. This involves using the predictive models to pinpoint specific conditions or stages that result in low recovery rates, enabling mining operations to make informed decisions to eliminate or modify these parameters.

**We need to predict two values**:

1. rougher concentrate recovery `rougher.output.recovery`
2. final concentrate recovery `final.output.recovery`
